# Kickstart your coding with Git and Github

This is a (hopefully) 2-part series organized for students of AIML department at [APSIT](https://www.apsit.edu.in/).  
It goes through the following parts:

## 0. Git setup and Theory

- Install Git on your system (Linux, Windows, macOS).
- Understand what version control is and why it's important.
- Learn about local vs. remote repositories.

## 1. Basic Git commands

- Initialize a Git repository (`git init`).
- Track changes with `git add`, `git commit`.
- Check repository status using `git status` and review history with `git log`.

## 2. Connecting to Github

- Create a GitHub account and connect using https.
- Link your local Git repository to GitHub with `git remote add`.
- Push your code to GitHub with `git push`.

## 3. Collaborating using Github

- Add collaborators to your repository using GitHub’s collaborators feature.
- Clone repositories with `git clone`.
- Synchronize changes between collaborators using `git pull` and `git push`.

## 4. README.md and .gitignore

- Create and format a README.md file to describe your project.
- Understand the importance of `.gitignore` for excluding unnecessary files.
- Discuss different scenarios where `.gitignore` comes into picture.

## 5. Deploying with Github pages

- Enable GitHub Pages for your repository.
- Push static website from a branch.
- View your live site hosted on GitHub.

## 6. Forking and Final Activity

- Fork a repository to make your own copy.
- Contribute changes via commits after forking.
- Final project or challenge using what you’ve learned.
